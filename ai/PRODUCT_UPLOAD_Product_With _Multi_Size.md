## 🎯 Quick Reference Card

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't forget to define sizes and colors BEFORE creating variants**
   - Add all 4 sizes (S, M, L, XL) first
   - Add Brown color first
   - Then create variants and select from the available options

2. **Don't use the same SKU for multiple variants**
   - Each size needs a unique SKU suffix: -S, -M, -L, -XL

3. **Don't forget individual alt text for images**
   - Each image should have descriptive, unique alt text
   - This is important for SEO and accessibility

4. **Don't forget to click the size/color buttons for each variant**
   - The buttons should turn blue/active when selected
   - Each variant needs at least one size selected

5. **Don't leave weight as empty string or 0**
   - Use 310.01 grams (add .01 to distinguish from zero)

---
